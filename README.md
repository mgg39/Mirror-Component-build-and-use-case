SeQUeNCe is a Simulator of QUantum Network Communication. This open-source tool allows modeling of quantum networks including photonic network components, control protocols, and applications.
Please see it's github: https://github.com/sequence-toolbox
It comprises multiple optical physical component files to simulate in lab experiments. 
This repository proposes an additional Mirror component through a use case.

Due to the 1 dimensional nature of SeQUeNCe, the mirror effectively serves as a loss surface in this specific set up, that comprises a 3 Node information chanel from a Light-Source to a Detector passing though a Mirror. 
This set up is the first set in my ongoing learning project to set up a Hong–Ou–Mandel effect based experiment within the platform.
